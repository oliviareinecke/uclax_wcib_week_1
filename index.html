      Hello everyone! I am an undergraduate Cognitive Science student at UCLA taking the quarter off. I am currently enrolled in this bootcamp as well as User Experience I: Survey. I am interested in completing the entire UCLAx UX certificate at some point, probably after I graduate. As of now, I wish to pursue a career in the UX field. I am working on a 2018 13" Macbook Pro that runs MacOs Catalina.

      I had a rather smooth time setting up my local and hosting environments. I had used GitHub in high school before, so it was interesting finding my old account. I created a new account to start fresh. Throughout this assignment, I did run into a few small issues. I did not know to press control C to stop grunt from "Waiting..." and I kept trying to type clear. I also needed to install shell commands to open atom from the terminal. I kept messing up which directory I was in, and had to keep changing back to the Desktop. To fix my issues, I just revisited the videos and paused them a lot. For the styling in CSS, I searched colors and other info online. I can already tell that certain programming habits will just come with practice and time.

      <p>Due to the quarantine, I have moved out of my dorm at school and returned home to the east bay. I visit many of the same websites I usually do, but I am exploring new websites as well. I am going to share some of my favorite links below. First, I would like to shoutout my favorite streaming service. I use Netflix for many hours of the day.</p>

      <p>I was inspired by my art history class last quarter to check out some of the world's most famous museums via virtual tours. Many of them are now free due to the COVID crisis. I particularly like the Louvre's tours.</p>

      <p>When school is in session, I spend way too much time looking at the dining hall menus. My friends and I must always choose the best menu before attending dinner. I am sad that I will no longer have a meal plan next year and will not get to waste my time on this website.</p>
